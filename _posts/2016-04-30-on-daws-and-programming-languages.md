As am I only too happy to discuss, my life is a mix of code and music. It follows that I always get the two questions I'm sure every music producer or programmer has heard in some variant:

> Man, I just want to (produce beats/learn to code) but I don't know where to start. I heard (FL Studio/Python) is for noobs, and (Ableton/Java) seems tight... but that learning curve, etc

Note the game of unintended Mad Libs that I have going on here.

On the surface, learning to write code and produce music may seem like very different entities. But they have one large thing in common: *beginners often remain stuck on how to begin due to an inability to pick an initial workflow*. I call this **workflow anxiety** because I couldn't really think of an existing term.


*Maschine- hip-hop/electronic production software*

*Atom- hipster web-dev text editor*

My music/code workflow, or at least a subset of it, is shown above. Certainly, I didn't start with either of these respective workflows. Nor are they the only ones in my arsenal. Rather, after many iterations and learning, I have chosen these for the moment. I could do this because I eventually got over the beginner hump and became proficient at different starter workflows.

###Just start
This is the point that I'd like to stress: with little exception, *it doesn't matter what you start with, as long as you become decent at one workflow*. Put into practice, this would mean taking the plunge and learning Javascript if you want to learn to program. Why Javascript? I just chose a random, well-documented language, that's why. The coding mindset you develop from learn Javascript will translate into all future languages (yes, even different language paradigms). Same goes for the accompanying development stack you create (e.g. code editor choice, debugging tools, online doc resources...).

Similarly, a starting producer should just pick something and dive into it, knowing that these skills can be transferred over. The predominant music software model, known as **D**igital **A**udios **W**orkstations, can vary immensely, but at their core they operate on a discrete abstraction of music where notes are drawn on a linear grid. Despite what fanboys on many a forum may say, there is no one DAW to start on. What matters is finding your groove in a single DAW, until you see the similarities in all of them, and grow to be mature enough in understanding what you want out of your workflow.

###... and don't stop
Workflow anxiety solved, just start. And keep that momentum going, I'm not advocating hopping around and half assing a bunch of tutorials and teaching methodologies. Rather, go in depth whatever you choose, finish a Youtube tutorial playlist or something comparable online, and then keep finessing your skills until you make something you're proud of.

Go ahead, get started.
