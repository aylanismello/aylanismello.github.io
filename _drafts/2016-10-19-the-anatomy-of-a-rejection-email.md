At a React meetup in SF last night, I heard a salient quote that really stuck with me.

> Abstraction is having noticed a pattern of repetition in your program
> and choosing to simplify it

I mean this is a really loose interpretation. It was something like that.

Fast forward to today, I open my inbox in the morning and am greeted with a fresh
new pile of rejection emails from my job hunt.

### Soundcloud
![soundcloud]({{ site.url }}/images/soundcloud_rejection.png)

### Trulia
![trulia]({{ site.url }}/images/trulia_rejection.png)

### Github
![github]({{ site.url }}/images/github_rejection.png)

We can abstract this into 3 primary chunks, the general pattern appears to be:


1. Thank me for applying.
2. Assurance that my application will be tucked away in some
'maybe later' pile.
3. Another thank you for applying.

In order to expedite this process for prospective hiring committee  / recruiter,
I whipped up this node package for your enjoyment.

`npm install rejectify`
