This fourth of July weekend some friends and I decided to camp at Sequoia National Park, a gorgeous western Sierra Nevada park located south of Yosemite. Only problem was, all campsites were completely booked.

Now, the alternative to straight out camping (not even considering cabins atm, don't got that $) would be backpacking, but those trips require permits and a load of equipment we didn't bring. And so our alternative was a type of camping I've never heard of: dispersal camping.

* Distribution camping
* Despair camping
* Destroyed camping
* Disdained camping
